        <p><strong> Nice to meet you!</strong><br><br>
            My name is Josh.  I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information, with a major in Digital Narratvie and Interactive Design.<br><br>
            You may not have heard of my major before, but it's really quite simple.  By graduating with this major, I have learned to combine elements of Computer Science with elements
              of English Writing to create stories, characters, and narratives that are interactive.  This can apply to online literature, video games, or even offline games.<br><br>
            Speaking of which, I would like to show you my passion for interactive characters and game design by directing you to my personal works involving the famous table-top game
              Dungeons and Dragons.  Not only have I written many characters to play the game, I have even written and designed my own story, along with the world that encompasses it.
              This story was written specifically to be interacted with, and to allow the players to experience my world and narrative in their own unique way.</p>
