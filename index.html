        <p><strong> Nice to meet you!</strong><br><br>
            My name is Josh.  I am a recent graduate from the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information, with a major in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design.<br><br>
            You may not have heard of my major before, but it's really quite simple.  By graduating with this major, I have learned to combine elements of Computer Science with elements
              of English Writing to create stories, characters, and narratives that are interactive.  This can apply to online literature, video games, or even offline games.<br><br>
            Speaking of which, I would like to show you my passion for interactive characters and game design by directing you to my personal works involving the famous table-top game
              Dungeons and Dragons.  Not only have I written many characters to play the game, I have even written and designed my own story, along with the world that encompasses it.
              This story was written specifically to be interacted with, and to allow the players to experience my world and narrative in their own unique way.</p>

        <p>My time at Pitt has been full of many ups and downs, but I feel like it was still an amazing experience and I am incredibly grateful for the oppurtunities it has presented me.
             I started out by working towards the Computer Science major, which used to be under Pitt's Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences.  I still have a lot of interest in technology,
              specifically in video games and their creation.  What changed, or maybe just what I realized, was that my interest lies not in the actual coding of the game, but instead of the
               design.  I am fascinated by how the stories of games are written and how they are intricately linked with the mechanics and design of the gameplay itself.  Luckily, the major
               Digital Narrative and Interactive Design was just what I was looking for, and was created just in time for me to be among the first class to graduate with it at Pitt.</p>

        <p>During my time at Pitt, I spent my time mostly with my roommate Owen, who is in the picture above.  We knew each other in high school, but became great friends when we began rooming
            together during our first semester there.  Together we expanded our friend group, and have had many fun experiences during our time here, and I can't thank all of them enough.</p><br>
